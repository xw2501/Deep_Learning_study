    "TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks now in the world. Originally created by Google, it has received a lot of community support. In this part, we're going to look at some basic TensorFlow concepts and operations, so that you can start playing with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tow-phase program\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 stages of using TensorFlow to create a program. First, we need to __assemle a computation graph__; Then, we use a __session__ to execute operations in that graph. All the operations that you define will not be run until a session is created. This is something like defining a function and use it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The graph\n",
    "The computation graph is a very important concept of TensorFlow. Modern neural networks are usually very complex, and the relations between variables can be hard to catch. In a computation graph, every opearation that you define is recorded as a node. An edge between 2 nodes means data will be exchanged between them. With __TensorBoard__, you can even visualize the graph you've created so far (will be covered later). \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why in TensorFlow, we need to first assemble such a graph, make sure everything is correct, and then execute it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-level APIs\n",
    "There are some other deep learning APIs built upon TensorFlow, providing easy access to users. A typical example is Keras, with which one can write one-line deep learning programs. __Note__: For the course we __prohibit__ the use of other high-level APIs. TensorFlow itself has a good API called TF Learn (tf.contrib.learn). We encourage you to use low-level opeartions and keep away from TF Learn.\n",
